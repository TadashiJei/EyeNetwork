# Machine Learning Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the integration points between the EyeNet system and the machine learning models developed for network analysis and optimization.

## Integration Points

### Machine Learning Models (External)
> Note: These models are developed and maintained by the ML team.

#### Expected Input/Output Interfaces
```json
{
    "input": {
        "network_data": {
            "traffic_patterns": "array",
            "bandwidth_usage": "float",
            "active_users": "integer",
            "time_of_day": "string",
            "day_of_week": "integer"
        }
    },
    "output": {
        "predictions": {
            "bandwidth_forecast": "float",
            "anomaly_score": "float",
            "recommended_actions": "array"
        }
    }
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `/api/ml/predict`: Get predictions from ML model
- `/api/ml/train`: Trigger model retraining
- `/api/ml/status`: Check model status
- `/api/ml/metrics`: Get model performance metrics

## Data Flow
1. EyeNet collects network data
2. Data is preprocessed and formatted
3. ML model processes the data
4. Results are integrated back into EyeNet
5. Predictions are displayed in dashboard

## Integration Requirements
- Regular data synchronization
- Error handling for model downtime
- Data format validation
- Performance monitoring
- Model version tracking

## Deployment Considerations
- Model serving infrastructure
- Data pipeline management
- Backup procedures
- Rollback capabilities
- Performance monitoring

## Security Measures
- Data encryption in transit
- Access control
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
